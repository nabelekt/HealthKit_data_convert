# HealthKit_data_convert
Convert a HealthKit XML file – containing health and fitness data from iOS (iPhone) and watchOS (Apple Watch) devices – to a CSV file. Plot the data in MATLAB.

While there are other scripts, websites, and apps (http://quantifiedself.com/qs-access-app/) to accomplish the same task, I found each one that I tried lacking in some way.

This project makes use of Python version 3. The version of Python installed by default in macOS, as of macOS 10.14 (Mojave), is Python 2.7.10.
